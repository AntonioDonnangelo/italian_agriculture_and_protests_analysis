## Non si mollaâ€¦ e che Dio ci benedica!
- *ISTAT_data_analysis_and_protests_mapping* encompasses datasets sourced from ISTAT (Italian National Institute of Statistics) and analytical notebooks aimed at investigating Italian agricultural production trends from 2006 to 2023. Additionally, it includes efforts to generate a geographical representation of the 2024 farmers' protests, derived from local news reports.
- *italy_and_green_deal* features an in-depth examination of structured datasets from CREA, Ismea Mercati, Eurostat, and similar sources. This analysis seeks to provide a comprehensive snapshot of the current state of Italian agriculture while exploring the underlying factors that have contributed to the large-scale protests in 2024.
- in *satellite_image_analysis*, we trained a deep convolutional neural network to classify land use and track its changes over time, providing valuable insights into the evolution of agricultural landscapes.
- *scraping_and_text_analysis* contains scripts used to collect data from Facebook and local news outlets, along with tools for conducting textual analysis of Facebook comments, shedding light on public sentiment and discourse.

The findings from our work were synthesized into a data-driven journalism article, which is available at the following [link](https://rconti95.github.io/g6-2024-website/) (optimized for desktop).

ðŸŽ“ Wrapping up our Master in Big Data & Artificial Intelligence for Society!

As the classes of our Master in Big Data & Artificial Intelligence for Society came to an end, on Friday 6th September my group and I were invited to the UniversitÃ  di Pisa to present the results of our final project, entitled "Non si molla... e che Dio ci benedica! - Analisi delle proteste agricole nel contesto italiano".

For our capstone project, we decided to explore the power of data science to describe and interpret social phenomena. When we chose our topic, Italy, and Europe in general, was being rocked by agri-food workers occupying streets, highways and squares to protest against the deterioration of their work conditions. 

While the media constantly showed us images of farm workers and their tractors, we found that their voices and those of industry experts were often overshadowed by third party (often sadly ill-informed or biased) opinions.

To address this, we adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our research drew from structured data sources such as Istat, Eurostat, CREA Ricerca, Ismea - Istituto di servizi per il mercato agricolo alimentare, as well as unstructured data from local news, satellite imagery, social media and interviews with workers and filed experts. Our aim was not just to document the protests, but also to uncover their underlying causes and context.
